# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

A command-line tool that analyses text files and generates word count and character frequency reports.

## Usage
```bash
python3 main.py <path_to_book>
```

## Example
```bash
python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt
```

Outputs total word count and character frequency sorted by occurrence.
